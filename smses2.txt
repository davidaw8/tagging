Hey Crissy, doing pretty well here with Jennings Energy Services. Running sales for our pipeline and facility division. Not sure a move to pump Tex would do me any good. Thank you for passing it my way.
Hi Stephanie. I did not receive any emails from you. I looked up Account Sense & see you are in Kennewick. We moved from the TC to Tucson 5 years ago. Please remove me from your email & text list. Did you find my resume on a website?
No thanks
Hi Crissy. Thank you for reaching out. At this time it does not seem like the position fits my next career move as I prefer to stay in management. Thank you again for the consideration.
My family member who had a little health scare this morning has to have some tests ran today at the hospital today. So if possible do you have time tomorrow morning. I just don't want to take up your slot at 3:30 and then I cannot talk because I'm at the hospital. Again, my apologies for today.
Great!
I would like to know more, can we talk?
Crissy I never saw. Was it sent to tcbault@yahoo ?
Good morning Crissy. I am interested in learning more about this position available with Pumptex, although unfortunately I have limited time today. May I request a call about this opportunity tomorrow morning?

Hello Crissy, Thank you for reaching out. The position looks interesting. I would most definitely be interested in knowing more about this opportunity. Please feel free to reach out by phone to set up the next step of interest. Thank you again. Wishing you a great day! Best, Olinda Ramirez 210-269-9077

RE: Call to Mr. (619-623-9393) - Thank you for calling. I will be back in touch.
Hi I didn't know there was an opening. I am very interested.
Hey Vicki. Thank you for reaching out and yes, I did receive the emails. At this time, I'm not interested but thank you again. Best of luck though.
? Wrong person maybe.
Thank you for thinking of me! I really love my private practice right now but I appreciate you thinking of me!
And flattered by the offer.
Wrong person
I'm really happy with my job currently. I am however curious how you retained my info.
Who is this and what is a brickhouse?
Just checked out your web site. I live mere minutes from Brick House. I have a question r/t billing. Its stated BH is private pay yet there are a list of insurance companies. Can you help me to understand differences. I'd like to understand r/t being able to make informed referrals. thxs
Yes I will be.
Vicki, nice to be considered for job but the truth is I would not be s good fit. Other than one college class r/t Addiction and a few SA CEU classes, I've only a general kind of education and not the accreditation to be a drug counselor let alone a treatment supervisor. As an LCSW most of the clients I see have CPTSD and general kind of issues. However, I had no idea there was a treatment center Meridian which is very good to know. I would love to see more info and to be able to make referrals. Thanks for contacting me and I wish Brick House Treatment Center much success in this significant yet underserved population. Sincerely, Honor Harris, LCSW
Thanks for sending. After reviewing I feel I lack the graphic design skills as I have a good understanding but not an expert. Please keep me in mind for any marketing or communications leadership roles

Oh this is Honor Harris. Am meeting with clients today.
No thank you Krystal. I'm happy at Google. Thank you!
No thank you
I'm not looking at making a change
Hey Krystal. You are persistent. Honestly, I'm not looking to get back in the recruitment space. Which is what this sounds like. You can call me if you want, I just to be upfront

I'm sorry, who is this?
ok no problem
