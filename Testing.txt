Hi Krystal. Sorry I didn't get back to you last night, I was on the road.

I see. What does the position entail?
Just curious. How did you get my contact info?
Wrong #
Thanks, but I'm currently not interested in changing jobs right now.
Not specifically, but always keeping my eye on the market.
You called me by name, so I'm sure you know who you're talking to. I don't appreciate my number being passed around and respectfully request you remove my number from your database so as not to pass it to someone else.
Or by text. Thanks!
I'm at work currently but I can text easily!
Unfortunately not by phone. If you want to email me you're more than welcome to.
I have a full day. I am quite happy with working my one job. You'll need to find some younger, hungrier CRNAs. Good luck
Hi Dan , I am actually on family vacation and can speak to you when I get back. I will be back in town on Monday July 16th.
I'm not a CRNA
Perhaps but I only work 7 days a month so I do a lot of off day work which has me in 300k range
Sure what days work for you
Wrong no.
Hi Dan I’m not sure what that is
Yes. What do you have available?
I think you have me confused with someone else - I am not a CRNA.
I'm in a case right now. I'll call you later
I'm not on linkedin
I have no clue who you are or what ypu are talking about
How did you get my number?
Hello what is CRNA?
Sorry, I'm headed to work. I actually don't have much free time with work, a business, and kids
You bet

Hi Chad, I’m not looking at this time, thanks. I’m also leaving the country for a couple of weeks very soon so I’ve been consumed by those plan & details, so I apologize for my lack of response
Not really. Booked pretty much
Do you have any details or a posting for this position that I could review?
No and no. Thank you!
Sorry no. Thanks
No thank you
But those are the main reasons I haven’t gotten back to you. Also, the gig at Code.org is also really fun and meaningful for me so I wasn’t necessarily looking to switch up. But it can’t hurt to learn more.
Also! I haven’t used Fan Duel and I know very little about fantasy sports 😬 Really selling myself here!
I will be out of the country to speak at a Google game launcher conference from July 21-31.
Hi Mike! Sure, I have to warn you upfront that I don’t watch a lot of sports, mostly just the Seahawks and the NBA playoffs, but if you still want to talk- I have time today or most evenings after 8:30.

Of course. Friday would probably be best for me. What times Friday do you have open? Also, do you have any information regarding the opening I could look at? The qualifications and duties involved, salary or hourly, pay scale, etc? Thank you!
I didn't see the email. What email address did you send it to?
Hey Mike, I took a look over the job description and I don't think I'm the person you're looking for. I have a lot of experience with many platforms (responsive web, voice, digital billboards, vr) but almost no work with native mobile. I'm still aware of hig/material design guidelines and use both Android and iOS, but I have no work to show you that would be relevant to the job responsibilities. I love draft Kings though, so thanks for thinking of me!
Maybe later
